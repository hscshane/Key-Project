# Key-Project
This project creates an Empirical model of the Solar Wind Charge Exchange

The goal of the key project is to characterize the SWCX properties and build a
semi-empirical model to make available through a web interface. At first order,
the intensities of O VII and O VIII depend linearly on solar wind conditions.

See KP_summary.pdf for project summary.

See Poster_HEAD2016.pdf for poster at AAS HEAD meeting.

My duty is mainly reviewing the code and develope a website for this project.
